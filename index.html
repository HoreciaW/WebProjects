   <p style="font-size:20px">In many sectors of life, information and communication technologies (ICT) are becoming more readily available to improve ease and efficiency. In the domains of government and public participation, ICT has special promise. Proponents of open government, government 2.0, and e-government think that governments may use information to minimise corruption and improve government transparency, accountability, efficiency, and citizen participation in the digital era. On many levels, how ICT can be a successful or unproductive tool in improving transparency and public involvement. In Liberia, the Tell-It-True text-messaging reporting system is used to detect problems on school and university campuses and motivate authorities to find solutions. Callers to the Indian interactive voice forum CGNet Swara can record local interest messages and listen to the messages of other callers. The remarks are also posted on the internet, where journalists, activists, and policymakers can view them.
To combat corruption, bribery, and delayed response times to complaints, the government of Punjab, Pakistan, has established a citizen feedback model that reaches residents via text messaging.
ICT tools can be highly effective in encouraging greater government openness and citizen participation, but they come with their own set of obstacles when it comes to access and use.

    <p style="font-size:20px">Artificial intelligence and other technological advancements enable current software to scan legal papers, simplify communications, and locate pertinent casework for lawyers. According to McKinsey, existing technology can automate 23% of the labour done by lawyers. Each year, modern technology replaces about 2% of a lawyer's total job. As law firms experimented with technologies that could speed the document review process in the early to mid 2000s, technology began to gnaw away at key legal jobs. Law firms would gather terabytes of data, upload it to a review platform, and then ask lawyers to conduct searches. The algorithms grew in popularity and sophistication over time. It is predicted that all white-collar workers will lose their jobs in the future to robots. The parameters are specified by humans, but computers reduce down the millions of documents. We can utilise legal forms in the same manner that we can use software to fill out our taxes and make a tax return in a few minutes for a few bucks at the end of the year.

   <p style="font-size:20px"> The edtech business is vast, ever-expanding, and comprised of a wide range of tools and technologies. According to studies, the sector was valued $89.49 billion in 2020, and it is anticipated to expand by 19.9% from 2021 to 2028. Any technology that aids in the learning process. However, the term "edtech" is frequently used to refer to the educational technology industry. Edtech can be classified as synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous learning occurs when numerous people interact in real time, such as in a virtual classroom or a zoom call.Learning management systems and email communication are examples of asynchronous learning that can be done at any time. Educational technology has been around since the 1960s, when computers were first introduced into the classroom. Technology, on the other hand, is always improving and becoming more prevalent in education. We've seen a complete shift in the way education is delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every aspect of education has had to improvise and learn to work online rather than in a classroom, as has been the case for as long as we can remember. As a result, online learning tools became a requirement inside the educational system quite quickly.Many features of online learning, on the other hand, have been shown to be more successful than traditional approaches. Because online learning has shown to be such a useful tool, it will undoubtedly continue to grow and become an important element of modern education. Blended learning, which combines online and offline learning, is also growing increasingly popular. Today's educational technology includes online learning platforms, virtual reality, mobile technology, and YouTube. </p>

<p> <b>  Artificial Intelligence (AI): </b> </b>
Whether it's for watching TV, dating, or shopping, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become a part of our lives. In various areas, AI has a substantial impact on mobile app development. The educational experience will be altered in a variety of ways as a result of this technology. One of the most significant benefits of AI technology in the education business is personalisation. </p>

<p> <b> Virtual Reality (VR):  </b> </b> is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment (VR). Virtual Reality (VR) has made great development in mobile learning over the last two years and has emerged as a powerful tool for online learning. For example, Anatomyou VR is a mobile app that teaches you about human anatomy. It uses virtual immersive 3D navigation to show anatomical structures of various human bodily systems. </p>
<p> <b> Augmented Reality (AR): </b> </b> AR is similar to virtual reality in that it simulates effects in the actual world rather than creating new virtual worlds. Google Interpret is a fantastic example of this, as it can translate text recorded with your camera in real time. You may use augmented reality learning experiences to play interactive learning games with students. This adds to the fun of training and opens up new possibilities. </p>
<p> <b> Chatbots: </b> </b> 
Virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa make our lives easier, and with their assistance, mobile learning will become even more streamlined. Voice assistants are utilised by over 3.5 billion people throughout the world. By 2024, there will be 8.4 billion voice assistant-enabled devices, more than the entire world's population. Chatbots allow lectures to be converted into chat dialogues, in addition to providing a personalised learning environment. It can also be used to make a series of messages out of lectures. The kids' comprehension level will be determined by this game-changing technology. Chatbots, in a nutshell, provide students with a personalised learning experience.</p>
<p> <b> Gamification: </b> </b>  When learning and enjoyment are mixed, students may be more engaged. Gamification has the power to make learning more enjoyable for students, resulting in higher levels of engagement. Gamification is critical for increasing student attentiveness. As a result, we may assert that the gamification boom will give online learning a competitive advantage. </p>
